# Arduino Pins Vs IC Pins

This batch file will help you when designing an embedded circuit using Arduino IC (Atmega 328P).
Pins defined in the Arduino IDE is perfectly differed from the IC pins. To use the Microcontroller outside the Arduino dev board, you need to know the IC pins first.
By running this file, everyone can easily find out the correct IC pin number corresponding to the Arduino Pin.
