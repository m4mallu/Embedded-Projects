# 8 Candidate Buzzer Quiz

### This is a Microcontroller(Atmega328P) based Quiz project.

There is an LED for each team in its corresponding color and one speaker. When your game night host asks a question, each team has the opportunity to buzz in.
When the first team pushes its button, the corresponding LED will light up for five seconds and a unique tone will play on the speaker for one second. Once the 
first team manages to press its button, the rest of the players or teams become “locked out” for five seconds so there is no confusion regarding who hit the button first!
